\subsection {{Research on neural network algorithm based on emotion regulation}\hfill May 2020}
\subtext{Bachelor's Thesis}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Compared the reservoir computing grid model before and after the addition of positive and negative emotion regulation mechanisms by using Matlab programming. 
\item Improved the accuracy of the algorithm in predicting the spatial and temporal evolutionary features of the dynamical system by adjusting the activation function and specific parameters of the neural grid.  
\end{zitemize}
